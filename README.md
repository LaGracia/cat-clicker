## Description

This is a Udacity minicourse project for JavaScript Design Patterns. The project consists of five quizzes. Each quiz features a number of cats and interactive components:

1. One cat
2. Two cats
3. At least five cats
4. Cat Clicker Premium: Model-View-Octopus code organization
5. Cat Clicker Premium Pro: Admin controls

### Project details

The [page](http://lagracia.github.io/cat-clicker/) features a list of cats and an area to display one selected cat. Users choose a cat by clicking on the button showing its name. An image of the selected cat, its name, and its score shows up in the display area.

The score for the chosen cat increases every time the user clicks on its image. When a second cat is chosen, the score for the first cat does not reset. It will continue from where it left off when the user clicks on the first cat again.

The final version of the site includes an admin view. This consists of buttons and a form with input fields.

### Credits

As always, I completed this project mainly by learning from others in the Udacity discussion forum, so thanks to all who posted questions and answered them there. My JS file includes where I found the solutions to the most difficult aspects of each quiz.
